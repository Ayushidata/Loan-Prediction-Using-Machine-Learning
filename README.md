# Loan-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on building a Machine Learning model to predict loan approval status based on applicant details such as income, education, credit history, loan amount, and other financial factors. The goal is to help financial institutions make data-driven, faster, and more accurate loan approval decisions.

# Objectives

Analyze and preprocess loan application data

Handle missing values and categorical variables

Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models

Predict whether a loan will be Approved or Rejected

Compare model performance using evaluation metrics
